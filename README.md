# Fuel Calculator App developed in Kotlin.

# Description
The fuel calculator app helps users calculate fuel efficiency and costs for their vehicles. It takes inputs such as distance traveled, fuel consumed, and fuel price per liter (or gallon) to provide the following outputs:

 - Fuel Efficiency: Calculates miles per gallon (MPG) or liters per 100 kilometers (L/100km).
 - Fuel Cost: Estimates the total cost of fuel based on the distance traveled and current fuel price.
# Features
 - Input Flexibility: Supports input in both metric (kilometers, liters) and imperial (miles, gallons) units.
 - Cost Estimation: Provides an estimate of fuel costs for a given trip or distance.
 - Efficiency Calculation: Computes the fuel efficiency of the vehicle based on user inputs.
